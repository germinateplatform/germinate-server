# Germinate Configuration
This page describes the content of Germinate's configuration folder. This folder does not exist and has to be created somewhere on the system where Germinate can access it.
The structure of this folder is shown below. At a minimum, the `config.properties` file needs to exist. The logos under `images/template` are used on the interface and should be adjusted to meet your requirements.


```

```

- `data`  
This directory contains all the raw data files that Germinate uses. At the moment those are genotypic data files and allele frequency files. These files are referenced in the database from the `datasets.source_file` column.
  - `allelefreq`  
  Files in this folder are stored in tab-delimited format with the germplasm along the side and markers along the top. Each cell contains the allele frequency value or should be empty.
  - `download`  
  This folder is auto-generated to store file resources. Do not touch it or the files within it.
  - `genotypes`  
  Genotypic data is stored in a custom `.hdf5` format. If you're using the Germinate Data Templates, then a file in this format will automatically be generated for you.
- `images`  
This directory contains all images that the Germinate user interface uses. This includes images referenced from the database as well as images that are part of the user interface template.
  - `climate`  
  Climate images are images referenced from the `climateoverlays` table. They are image overlays shown on top of maps on the user interface.
  - `database`  
  This directory contains image files referenced from the `images` table in Germinate. Germplasm images can be uploaded by data curators and administrators from the passport page of the corresponding germplasm. Images uploaded this way will automatically be placed here.
  - `news`  
  Images referenced from the `news` table are stored in this directory. News items can be created by data curators or administrators from the home page of Germinate. Images uploaded this way will automatically be placed here.
  - `template`  
  This directory contains images referenced from the user interface. This includes the logo (`logo.svg` and `logo-horizontal.svg`) and crop image (`crop.svg`) as well as images used in the carousel on the dashboard.
- `template`  
This directory holds configuration files for the Germinate user interface.
  - `locales.json`  
  This file defines the user locales or languages that should be available for this copy of Germinate. Here is an example that defines *British English* and *German* as the two available languages. Nore that the `flag` property should be the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code for the that best represents that locale. The `locale` properties is always of the form `{ISO 639-1}_{ISO 3166-1 alpha-2}` ([ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2))
  
      ```json
      [{
        "locale": "en_GB",
        "flag": "gb",
        "name": "British English"
      }, {
        "locale": "de_DE",
        "flag": "de",
        "name": "Deutsch - Deutschland"
      }]
      ```
  - `carousel.json`  
  This file contains the configuration for the image carousel on the Germinate carousel. Here is an example of such a file. Note that the images referenced here would have to be stored in the `images/template` directory. The key of each set of images (e.g. `de_DE`) should always be one of the locales defined in the `locales.json` file.  
      ```json
      {
        "de_DE": [
          {
            "name": "fullimage1.jpg",
            "text": "Germinate ist eine generische Datenbank für pflanzengenetische Ressourcen die Hilfsmittel für die Aufbewahrung von Standardsammlungsinformationen und Pflanzenausweisdaten sowie kompliziertere Datentypen wie phänotypische, genotypische und Feldexperimentdaten bereitstellt."
          },
          {
            "name": "fullimage2.jpg",
            "text": "Wir fokussieren uns auf die Bereitstellung von Lösungen für aktuelle biologische Herausforderungen und entwickeln neuartige Visualisierungen und Benutzeroberflächen die es Benutzern erlauben mehr aus ihren Daten zu machen."
          }
        ],
        "en_GB": [
          {
            "name": "fullimage1.jpg",
            "text": "Germinate is a generic plant genetic resources database and offers facilities to store both standard collection information and passport data along with more advanced data types such as phenotypic, genotypic and field trial data."
          },
          {
            "name": "fullimage2.jpg",
            "text": "We focus on delivering solutions to current biological problems and develop novel visualizations and interfaces to allow users to get more from their data."
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
  - `en_GB.json`  
  This is an example file of one of the possible locale files. Germinate always supports the locale `en_GB` (British English), but also any other locale defined in the `locales.json` file. Files like `en_GB.json` allow you to define custom text within this language. For British English, it would suffice to only specify the text you want to change. For any other language, you'll have to provide your own file (e.g. `de_DE.json`) containing all the text on the interface. A list of all entries can be found in [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/germinateplatform/germinate-i18n).
- `config.properties`  
This is the most important file in your customization. It defines the required properties for Germinate without which it couldn't work. This includes properties like the database details and user credentials as well as various customization options.

```ini
# Database properties. Server name, database name and user name are required.
# A password may be optional depending on your configuration and the port only needs to be provided if it's not 3306.

# Gatekeeper Configuration

If you're using Gatekeeper for user authentication or you would like to use the data upload mechanisms offered by Germinate, then Gatekeeper needs to be properly configured.
Please follow the documentation at https://germinateplatform.github.io/gatekeeper-server/ to set up Gatekeeper.

Once running, you will need to create a new user in Gatekeeper that Germinate can use to authenticate itself. To this end, create a new user with `Administrator` permissions for the default Gatekeeper (not Germinate) database.
You can then use the username and password of this new account in the Germinate configuration by providing: `gatekeeper.username` and `gatekeeper.password`.
